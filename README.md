## Overview
This project aims to effectively identify the risks associated with different aircraft by analysing historical aviation accident data. By identifying the patterns, trends, and risk factors that influence aircraft safety, it will facilitate the determination of the lowest risk venture aircraft for purchase by the company and the viable  operation of the aircrafts for commercial and private enterprises. The dataset covers approximately 24,000 aviation accidents worldwide that occurred between 1919 and 2023. Since the company is exploring entry into the aviation sector, it is crucial to understand the historical safety records of different aircraft types, operators, and regions in order to make well-informed decisions.
 

## Business Understanding
The company's goal is not just to diversify its portfolio but also to efficiently identify the risk associated with each aircraft type in order to make well-informed investment decisions for their business endeavour. This lack of clarity on the potential risks involved with an aircraft venture calls for a need to have data-driven insights that would positively lead to optimized decision-making in the critical areas.

To achieve this, the following business questions have been developed:
* Which of the aircraft types contribute the least to aircraft accidents?
* Which locations are performing well, which ones are subject to the most aircraft accidents and what could be the cause?
* Which are the most profitable aircrafts types regardless of the accident frequency and based on accident frequency?
* How are the accidents trending over time e.g. (monthly, quarterly, yearly) and do they have any influx at certain time periods?

## Data Understanding and Analysis
### Source of data
The dataset used for this analysis is the [Aviation Accidents Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drealbash/aviation-accident-from-1919-2023/data) that provides a comprehensive record of aircraft accidents that occurred between the years 1919 and 2023. This dataset captures crucial details of each accident, including the date of the incident, registration number of the aircraft involved, the country where the accident occurred, the specific location, the category of the accident, and the number of fatalities.
