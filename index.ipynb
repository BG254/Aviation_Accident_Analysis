    "This analysis aims at identifying the least-risk aircraft type that would encourage a well-informed purchase based on historical accidents data. This will be done by examining several variables such as accident frequency, fatality rates, aircraft type, operator and geographical distribution. This will consequently highlight the aircraft and operational environments that are associated with the highest and lowest levels of risk. Afterwards, this data will be used by the company to adjust capital investment, training programs and operational focus to improve resource allocation and minimize financial exposure in this new business endeavor.

Given that this involves purchasing and operating arplanes for commercial and private enterprises, all the risks involved have to be mitigated to a sustainable level. This ensures that the resource allocation will not only yield profits but also allows the the company to better serve its clients since it is expanding the scope of services they can offer. Using the NTSB Aviation Accidents data, I describe patterns in accidents frequency and accidents location  to anticipate the lowest-risk aircraft to invest in.\n"
